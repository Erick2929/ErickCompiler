# ErickCompiler

## About

ErickCompiler is a C#-based language compiler developed in Python using PLY yacc. This project includes components such as a lexer, parser, and tools for intermediate code generation and operation evaluation. It supports various data types, arithmetic, relational and logical operators, assignments, control statements, loops, dimensioned variables, and function calls.

## Features

- **Lexer Analysis**: Tokenizes the input source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Parser**: Syntax analysis and parse tree generation.
- **Code Generation**: Converts parse trees into an intermediate code form.
- **Operation Evaluation**: Executes intermediate code to perform computations.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Erick2929/ErickCompiler.git
